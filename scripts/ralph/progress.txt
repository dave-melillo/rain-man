# Rain Man Progress Log

## Project Overview
Casino strategy app focusing on blackjack basic strategy.
Tech: Next.js 14 + Tailwind (frontend), FastAPI optional for backend later.

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use v24.13.0` before running npm/npx commands
- Tailwind theme colors are in `frontend/tailwind.config.ts` under `colors.casino`
- Use `text-gold-gradient` class for gold gradient text effect
- Layout is in `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` with sticky header
